# Capstone project scenario overview: Working for Salifort Motors
  
About the company
Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifortâ€™s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.        

My business case
As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, I have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked me with analyzing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they would like me to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their  department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points you deem helpful. 

The value of my deliverable
For this deliverable, I'm asked to choose a method to approach this data challenge. Select either a regression model or a tree-based machine learning model to predict whether an employee will leave the company. Both approaches are shown in the project exemplar, but only one is needed to complete your project.
