### Key Objectives
* **Analyze employee survey data:** Identify relevant variables and their relationships.
* **Develop a predictive model:** Create a model (regression or tree-based) to predict employee attrition.
* **Provide actionable insights:** Offer recommendations based on the model's findings to enhance retention.

### Data Considerations
* **Employee survey data:** Likely includes demographic information, job satisfaction, work-life balance, compensation, etc.
* **Relevant variables:** Consider factors like department, number of projects, average monthly hours, tenure, and potentially others.

### Potential Model Approaches
1. **Regression Models:**
   * Linear regression: Suitable for continuous outcomes (e.g., predicting attrition probability).
   * Logistic regression: Ideal for binary outcomes (e.g., predicting whether an employee will leave or stay).

2. **Tree-Based Machine Learning Models:**
   * Decision trees: Can handle both continuous and categorical variables, providing interpretable rules.
   * Random forests: An ensemble of decision trees, often improving prediction accuracy and reducing overfitting.
   * Gradient boosting machines (GBM): Iteratively builds a model by combining weak learners, often achieving high performance.

### Deliverable Expectations
* **Model development and evaluation:** Explain the chosen model, its rationale, and evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
* **Insights and recommendations:** Clearly communicate the model's findings and propose actionable strategies to address employee retention issues.
* **Data visualization:** Use visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) to enhance understanding and communication of results.
